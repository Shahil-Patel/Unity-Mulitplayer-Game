# Unity-Mulitplayer-Game
Repository containing my Unity VR Fruit Ninja Game Copy. Users can play with another person and the premise of the game is to be "it" for the shortest amount of time possible. Multiplayer functionality is run by Photon while the actual game is made using pure Unity 3D. Coded in C#
